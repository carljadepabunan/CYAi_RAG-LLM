      1. Mr. Carl Jade Pabunan
      2. Mr. Yousif Aboud Elsiddig
      3. Mr. Arth Ruther Berango

### 📍 Web Application Demo Link
      https://cyai-rag-llm.streamlit.app/
### 📍 What Is **CYAi**?
- It is a chatbot uses _RAG-LLM_ technology focuses on developing students knowledge, students can upload PDF files and chat with CYAi about the PDF files they upload.
- CYAi means; C-carl, Y-yousif, A-arth, Ai-Artificial intelligence. Carl, Yousif, and Arth was the three programmers developed CYAi
- **fun fact:** "CYAi is our _AI6100-AI Prompt Engineering Course "By AMA University"_ final project and it was inspired on one of the United Nation SDG which is No Poverty and Quality education."
### 📍 What Is **RAG-LLM**?
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a structural method designed to enhance the performance of large language model (LLM) applications by utilizing specialized data. This process involves fetching documents or information pertinent to a specific question or task and supplying them as context for the LLM. RAG has proven effective in applications such as support chatbots and question-and-answer systems that require current information or access to specialized knowledge in a particular field.
